title: Soroban Settings
---

Soroban has a large set of settings stored on ledger that can be modified
through a validator vote. This document describes how to propose a new settings
upgrade, and how to examine a proposed upgrade. You can also look at the
[commands.md](commands.md) doc for more details on the stellar-core commands used below.

## Propose a settings upgrade

This section will describe how to propose a settings upgrade, but take a look at
the [admin page](admin.md#upgrading-soroban-settings) for more information on
how the settings upgrade mechanism works internally. **If you are just being asked
to vote for an upgrade, please move on to the [Examine a proposed upgrade](#examine-a-proposed-upgrade) step for details on how to examine a
proposed upgrade.**

1. Using the stellar-xdr rust tool and a JSON file as input, run `stellar-xdr encode --type ConfigUpgradeSet JSON_FILE`. [phase1.json](../../soroban-settings/phase1.json) can be used as a template to propose upgrades.
    - Example output - `AAAAAQAAAAsAAAAM` (note that this string can be much larger depending on the settings you're upgrading)
    - stellar-xdr can be installed with brew (`brew install stellar/tap/stellar-xdr`) or cargo (``cargo install --locked stellar-xdr --features cli``). You can also download the binary for your system here https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-xdr/releases/tag/v20.0.2.

2. Using the output from the command above, run the `stellar-core get-settings-upgrade-txs PUBLIC_KEY SEQ_NUM NETWORK_PASSPHRASE --xdr CONFIG_UPGRADE_SET_XDR --signtxs` command. Note that you will be submitting transactions, so the account for the public key specified must exist and have the funds to pay the transaction fees.
    - Example command - `stellar-core get-settings-upgrade-txs GAUQW73V52I2WLIPKCKYXZBHIYFTECS7UPSG4OSVUHNDXEZJJWFXZG56 73014444032 "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015" --xdr AAAAAQAAAAsAAAAM --signtxs`
    - You will be prompted for the secret key that corresponds to the public key passed in. Provide it to sign the transactions required to set up the upgrade.
    - Sample output with truncated `TransactionEnvelopes`
        - AAAAAgAAAABi/B0L0JGythwN1lY0aypo19NHxvLCyO5tBEc...wF9wL68IAAAAdkJxSgpyRStTvbSA9jgs=

        - AAAAAgAAAABi/B0L0JGythwN1lY0aypo19NHxvLCyO5tBEc...F9wX14QAAAAARAAAAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAAGd/IhWQcE2UdzIof7ygqCuAmYD8ycsJbB

    - This is the format of the output above - <br> 
        &ensp;1.Base64 upload `TransactionEnvelope` XDR<br>
        &ensp;2.Hex tx ID for the upload tx<br>
        &ensp;3.Base 64 create `TransactionEnvelope` XDR<br>
        &ensp;4.Hex tx ID for the create tx<br>
        &ensp;5.Base64 invoke `TransactionEnvelope` XDR<br>
        &ensp;6.Hex tx ID for the invoke tx<br>
        &ensp;7.Base64 `ConfigUpgradeSetKey` XDR<br>
3. Submit three transactions to the network to set up the upgrade, replacing the blob placeholders below with the `TransactionEnvelopes` in lines 1, 3, and 5.
    1. `curl -G 'http://localhost:11626/tx' --data-urlencode 'blob=<LINE_1_OUTPUT>'`
    2. `curl -G 'http://localhost:11626/tx' --data-urlencode 'blob=<LINE_3_OUTPUT>'`
    3. `curl -G 'http://localhost:11626/tx' --data-urlencode 'blob=<LINE_5_OUTPUT>'`
4. You can verify that the proposed upgrades have been set up using the `dumpproposedsettings` and the output from line 7 (the `ConfigUpgradeSetKey`)
    1. `curl -G 'http://localhost:11626/dumpproposedsettings' --data-urlencode 'blob=<LINE_7_OUTPUT>'`
5. Now schedule the upgrade on all the required validators using the output from line 7 (the `ConfigUpgradeSetKey`) and an agreed upon time in the future
    1. `curl -G 'http://localhost:11626/upgrades?mode=set&upgradetime=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' --data-urlencode 'configupgradesetkey=<LINE_7_OUTPUT>'`


## Examine a proposed upgrade

You can use the `dumpproposedsettings` http command along with a base64 encoded XDR
serialized `ConfigUpgradeSetKey` to query a proposed upgrade. 
Example - `curl -G 'http://localhost:11626/dumpproposedsettings' --data-urlencode 'blob=A6MvjFLujnqaZa5hacafWyYwhpk4cgRpyu0z6ilZ0pm1S7fmjSNnsyjGwGodLGiD8ss8S1AHiOBBb6GQbOeMbw=='`

You can also get the current Soroban settings to compare against by using the command under the [Examine current settings](#examine-current-settings) section.

## Examine current settings

Examine the current settings with `curl -G 'http://localhost:11626/sorobaninfo' --data-urlencode 'format=detailed'`.
